                    Photo Organization is a Python program that moves photos from an unsorted folder to a sorted folder. 
                    The photos are placed within two folders corresponding first to the photo's creation year and then 
                    further into a folder corresponding to the folder's creation month. This page provides an overview 
                    of the code but may at times become outdated. The latest code can be found 
                    <a href="https://github.com/CodingAero/PhotoOrganization">on the associated GitHub page</a>.

                    The script can be run using the following command:

                    PROCESSED ----------------------------------------------------------------
                    JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg):
                        A widely used format for photos, known for its good compression and ability to handle a wide range of colors, but it can also result in some image quality loss.
                    PNG (.png):
                        A lossless format that's good for images with sharp details and transparency, often used for web graphics.
                    GIF (.gif):
                        A format known for its ability to support simple animations and images with a limited color palette, often used for web graphics and simple animations.
                    BMP (.bmp):
                        A simple, uncompressed image format that's commonly used on Windows systems, but can result in large file sizes.
                    HEIF (.heic, .heif):
                        A high-efficiency image format developed by Apple that offers better compression and quality than JPEG, often used on iPhones and iPads.
                    TIFF (.tiff):
                        A versatile format that's often used for high-quality images and professional photography, known for its ability to preserve image quality and metadata.
                    SVG (.svg):
                        A vector graphics format that's designed for web use, allowing for scalable images that can be displayed on different devices and resolutions.

                    IGNORED ------------------------------------------------------------------
                    WebP (.webp):
                        A modern format developed by Google that offers a good balance of image quality and file size, often used for web images.
                    EPS (.eps):
                        A vector graphics format that's used for images that need to be scalable without losing quality, often used in print and design applications.
                    RAW (.raw):
                        A format that captures the raw data from a camera's sensor, offering the most flexibility for editing, but also resulting in large file sizes.
                    PDF (.pdf):
                        A versatile format that can contain images and other content, often used for sharing documents and portfolios.
                    AVIF (.avif):
                        A modern image format that uses the AV1 video codec for efficient compression, offering high quality and small file sizes.
